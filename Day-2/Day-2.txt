1. Write a blog on the difference between document and window objects.

Document Objects :

    * It's like a map of your webpage, showing all the elements like paragraphs, images, and buttons and their relationships.
    * It Helps you change things inside your webpage—like updating text, tweaking images, or adding new elements.
    * All about the details inside your webpage—like the words, pictures, and buttons.
    * It takes charge when you click a button, fill out a form, or interact with things on the webpage.
    * Lives inside your HTML document, focusing on what's happening within it.

Window Objects :

    * It Think of it as the boss overseeing the entire browser window or tab.
    * It Takes care of bigger tasks, such as managing the size of the window, handling multiple tabs, or opening new windows.
    * It Deals with the big picture, looking at the whole browser environment.
    * It Jumps in for tasks like changing the size of the window, keeping track of where you've been (navigation), or managing time-related actions.
    * Is like the big boss of the browser, overseeing everything happening in the window or tab.
